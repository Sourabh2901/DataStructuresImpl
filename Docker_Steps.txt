*****************Steps to Containerize our Java application in docker container****************

Step 1 -> First ,package our java application in executable jar file with the help of maven command i.e (mvn package)

Step 2 -> Download openJdk image.                                               (docker pull openJdk)

Step 3 -> Run the Docker Container                                              (docker run -dit openjdk)

Step 4 -> Go to our project location and open terminal.                             

Step 4 -> Copy our executable jar file in docker container /tmp folder          (docker cp <project-path> <ContainerId> ls /tmp)

Step 5 -> Now we need to commit our docker image and change default process configured forour jdk container i.e 
            (docker commit --change='CMD ["java","-jar","/tmp/rest-demo.jar"]' bold_lumiere docker/demo:v1)
            (               <Changing default command of container>            <Container-name>     <Image-name>)

Step 6 -> Now we need to run our container by command. (docker run -p 8081:9090 <image-name>)
            here ,we need to change our default port number becoz docker has it's own networking componenet.
